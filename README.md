# SENTIMENT-ANALYSIS-FOR-IMDB-REVIEWS
In this project, we conducted sentiment analysis on IMDb movie reviews. Our goal was to determine whether these reviews conveyed positive or negative sentiments. Leveraging Python, we meticulously cleaned the data, removing irrelevant information and standardizing text formats. Techniques like stemming and stop-word removal were applied to enhance data quality. We then utilized TF-IDF, a method for evaluating word importance, and employed classification models such as Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes to predict sentiment. This project underscores our proficiency in data preprocessing, NLP, and machine learning, demonstrating the potential of these techniques in extracting insights from textual data.
